Hi! My name is Katherine and I am a recent Computer Science graduate with an interdisciplinary background in geology and chemistry. My path to computer science was far from linear, but it was ultimately driven by my desire to keep learning and challenge myself. What unifies my interests across these fields is my fascination with how the big picture is shaped by the smallest details.

In chemistry, a single bond can be the difference between a poison and a life-saving medicine. In geology, tiny bioturbators can determine whether oil will be discovered or not. In computer science, one line of code can decide if a rocket makes it to the moon. Any small change—a chemical bond, a local fault, or a single character—can have large-scale consequences. I am constantly thinking about scale, both in time and space, and this philosophy drives my work ethic.

At work, I clearly define the overall goals of a project and make sure each small piece is carefully attended to, knowing that all the details matter. Outside of work, I am passionate about health and fitness and recognize that every rep, every hour of sleep, all contribute to a potential personal record down the road. Applying this philosophy requires constant mindfulness, and while it is always a skill in practice, I strive to resist complacency and to continually seek growth.

I am looking forward to new employment opportunities as I transition into computer science. I believe I offer a diverse perspective and a strong work ethic, and I would enjoy collaborating with a passionate team. Although I am new to the field, I am not new to hard work or to stepping up to a challenge. Whatever I don’t yet know, I’ll be eager to figure out.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions you may have – I’d love to chat.
